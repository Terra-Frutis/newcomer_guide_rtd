# Banana Processing

Some of the following steps may seem a waste of time. But they matter because others will also be eating the fruits of your labour.

1. Check with a long term resident for which bananas to dehydrate. Suitable ones are ripe but not decaying. Leave enough for people to eat.
2. Rats & cockroaches crawl on some bananas (yuck) so wash the bananas first.
3. Wash your hands and the work location.
4. Carefully peel each banana without contaminating the edible part. Remove any bad spots.
5. If insects are near, limit them from touching the food. For example cover them or use the fan.

## For Freezing

* Cut in pieces a few centimetres (1-2 inches) long
* Don't mix plantains with bananas
* Avoid mixing different kinds of bananas. Allow people to select the kind they like. If necessary to put 2 varieties in the same container, keep them divided.

## For Dehydrating

1. Slice bananas lengthwise. No thicker than 1 cm.
2. Staying within the mesh, place slices in compact parallel pattern, barely touching each other.
3. Speed up the drying process by flipping the slices once the first side is getting quite dry.
4. For eating soon, they're best when slightly moist. For long-term storage (outside the fridge), full dryness is necessary.
