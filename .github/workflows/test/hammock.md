# Hammock usage and safety guidelines

* Make sure the hammock and its straps, knots and carabiners are in good condition and properly attached before using it.
* The higher you hang, the harder you fall. Avoid hanging the hammock higher than 50 cm (20 in) off the ground and also check what's underneath you (hardness, sharpness, etc).
* Don't jump in the hammock.
* **Go in slowly**, sit before lying fully.
* Hammocks can only withstand a certain weight, **no more than one person** at a time.
* Empty your pockets, before going in the hammock, of **sharp objects** such as keys and knives.
* The best way to relax in your hammock is diagonal. This way you can spread the hammock to its maximum width to have more space and lay flatter.
* Please report promptly any damage or malfunction of a hammock.
