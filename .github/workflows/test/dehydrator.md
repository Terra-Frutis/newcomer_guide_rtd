# Dehydrator usage instructions

- **After use, clean** as soon as possible:
    + the **inside of the dehydrator**, removing anything that may have fallen from a tray.
    + **the sheets and trays** used. If they have sticky dry residue, you can put them to soak in the big sink, but please clean them within one day.
- Do not put sheet or tray on the drying rack. They fall easily, get wet, are in the way. Instead, put them back in the dehydrator and run a little (less than Â½ hour) until everything is dry.
- Larger dehydrators require more energy. **Use the smallest possible** for the job.
- **Do not cut with a knife while on the sheet**, it will likely get damaged.
